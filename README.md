LIBRARY PROJECT.

This is my second javascript project and it is a library page that saves books you have or have not read.
This is my first commit and it is displayed in a tab form. 
During this build, i learnt how to display an input in a tab form in javascript.
I also learnt how to save items to local storage so yes your book inputs are saved in your local storage.
I also learnt what JSON.Stringnify is hehehe. Before this, i had no idea what it was.

Still working on displaying the book inputs in a tabular form. stay tuned!
